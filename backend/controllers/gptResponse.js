Your task is to create a comprehensive travel itinerary based on the following details:

City Name: ${cityName}
Budget: rs ${budget}

Please generate a daily itinerary in JSON format that outlines places to visit each day, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Make sure that the attractions are logically set, meaning they should be on the same route or in close proximity to each other. Each entry should include a brief description of the place, and ensure that the meal options are conveniently located near the dayâ€™s attractions. 
Keep in mind the following:  

The itinerary should include at least three activities per day.  
Provide a brief overview of the city, including its main attractions and cultural significance.  
Ensure that the dining options cater to a range of tastes and are within a reasonable distance from the day's activities.
